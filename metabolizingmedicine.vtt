00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.030
-Hey Gabby, have you finished the homework yet for

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.625
that computation in medicine class?

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.470
-No, there was this one problem

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.020
though is so long I didn't get to it yet.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.375
Is it the one that has all those parts,

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:19.980
like the four parts or whatever?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.995
Oh, yeah. Okay. Let's take a look at that then.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:27.960
Okay. So we have a doctor monitoring a patient's reaction to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.110
a medicine and what's

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.250
recorded is the amount of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.930
medicine and the patient's body.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.735
And it's measured in grams,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.555
and it's recorded every other hour.

00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:40.850
And so here's where it shows

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.430
the chart with the readings

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.140
for how much medicine there is.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.045
And so the first part,

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:50.495
we need to sketch a piecewise linear function

00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:53.450
to approximate the actual function of what

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.625
the true value of the medicine is over the interval 1-11.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.160
And we need to find the average rates of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.920
change in each of those two-hour periods.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.800
And then we need to find a formula

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.950
for the whole piece-wise linear function.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.595
And then there's that last part where we anticipate

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:18.710
what the average rate of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.815
change between the 11th and 13th hour is.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.080
-So we have to do all that.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.505
And that last part,

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:27.245
it seemed kind of open-ended to me.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:28.775
-Yeah, it looks that way.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:29.990
I think from what

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.600
the professor said in class that she just wants us to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.020
say like how steep or shallow the slope

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.845
is for the 11th and 13th hour compared to the other ones.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:42.410
And if it's positive or negative,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.390
or if it's increasing or decreasing.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.965
-see, I thought we had to figure out

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.650
an exact value or in a formula for it.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.990
-Yeah. No. I think because

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.210
there's not enough information there for that.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.910
That's all that that's all that we need to do.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.495
-Okay

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:58.100
-Okay. So let's, let's look at that.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.200
So the first part is just sketching the function.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.410
So let's, let's draw that out.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.090
Let's say we have here this r coordinates.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:21.539
Let's say here's 1,3,5,7, 9,11. 1,2

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.170
And Let's see.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.880
So we have that's 0.61 at 1,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.325
so it's right around here.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:41.585
And then we have that's 1.47 at three.

00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.435
-Wait, how do we know which axis is which again?

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:45.830
-Oh, that's a good point.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.325
Yeah. I think this is the this is the time in

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:53.430
hours and then this is the quantity of the medicines.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.420
Let's call this f of t, I guess.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.610
Since that's the function that we're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.860
going to draw to approximate it.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.780
So, okay, So for time 3 we get 1.47.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.975
So it's like around here maybe.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:13.040
And then for time 5, it's 2.01.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.290
So it's basically right at two.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.990
And then five time 7,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.565
it's basically the same place.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.770
We'll just draw a teeny bit higher.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.430
And then at 9, it's at 0.91.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.745
So it's dropped back down to being below one here,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:30.725
like right around there.

00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:35.810
And at time 11, it's 0.49 slick maybe here.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.270
So then we wanted to have a piecewise linear function.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.849
So we can just connect these dots.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.160
And that'll give us the lines that we want

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.220
to use for our piece-wise linear function.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.210
-Oh, because we want a piecewise linear function,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.100
we have to connect them with lines.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.550
-Yep, Exactly. Okay. -Okay. And so,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.220
and this is on the interval 1 to 11.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.665
So I think that's all we need to do for that part.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.735
-Okay. So this is part one and we're done.

00:04:05.735 --> 00:04:07.610
-Yeah, so let's, let's label that.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.190
So here's Part one, and that's it.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.365
So for part two,

00:04:12.365 --> 00:04:15.275
so now I need to find the average rates of change.

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:16.715
-So does that mean we could

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.025
figure out the slope that's average rate of change.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:20.450
-Yeah, exactly. So if we just

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.010
find the slopes for each of these lines,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.645
that'll give us what we want so

00:04:23.645 --> 00:04:25.490
we know that our change in

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.980
t. Let's do the first two

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.490
and I can just send you the slides for the others.-okay, sounds good

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.500
So we know that

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.820
the amount that t is changing here is 1 to 3.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.890
So we know that for our denominator.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.090
So let's call this like our slope m, at like one.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.730
We know that for here,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.915
the t value is changing 1-3.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.330
So we do three minus one.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.750
And we know that the f of t value is

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.220
changing from 0.61 to 1.47.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.800
So we do 1.47 minus 0.61.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.180
And then let's see.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.300
So that's simplifies over two.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.005
Let's see. I think that's 0.86.

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.355
Yes. Is that right?

00:05:16.355 --> 00:05:24.335
Okay. Over 2 is 0.43.

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:26.810
And then let's see, let's do one more.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.595
So m of three.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.985
So if we're looking 3-5 now,

00:05:31.985 --> 00:05:38.150
we get that we're changing from 1.47 to 2.01.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.430
So let's put that on the top.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.735
And then on bottom we're changing 3 and 5.

00:05:44.735 --> 00:05:46.940
So five minus three.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.050
I think that's 0.54 on top. It's that right?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.530
-Yes. but we need equal sign there

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.460
-oh, yeah, you're right.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.865
Good point 0.5, 4/2 is 0.27.

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:02.375
-Yeah.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:04.820
Then we do the exact same thing for the other ones.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.660
So I think you can do it later.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.530
-That's not too bad.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.025
-Okay.

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:13.955
-Yeah, exactly. So then

00:06:13.955 --> 00:06:16.130
we get to the next part where we need to

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.200
find a formula for the whole function,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.300
-oh okay, so we have to write equations for

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.505
lines for each part. -Right

00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:24.170
Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.680
So so we have the slopes

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.270
for the lines because we figured out what

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.385
the average rate of change was already.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:32.795
So then it's just a matter

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:35.510
of like writing out the equations for them.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.010
Yeah. So we know that, um, let's see.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.875
So let me write my piecewise function here and I won't,

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:43.970
I won't finish it because I'll

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.275
I'll send you the slides for it.

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.660
But let's see.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.130
So we know that 1 to 3,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.350
we have f of t. If we want to

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.885
find what the Y-intercept of it is,

00:06:56.885 --> 00:07:01.969
we have f of t is changing along here.

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.250
So we could do f of t minus

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.490
whatever the initial value is there, which is 0.61.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.890
Okay? So we have f of t minus 0.61.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.985
And that's how much, that's how much we're changing here.

00:07:16.985 --> 00:07:20.480
Vertically. How much we're changing horizontally,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.685
while we have t at some value, starting at one.

00:07:25.685 --> 00:07:28.895
And this is equal to the rate of change,

00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:30.905
which we got with 0.43.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:32.840
-Okay, so we're just basically using

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.925
the rate of change formula to figure out our line.

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:37.280
-Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm doing.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.805
So I should say this is for

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:49.715
1 to 3 -how come is less than -well,

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:52.490
I mean, I guess the best way to explain it,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.930
there'll be the same value on both of the lines.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.490
Subtle end up with. So I guess it doesn't

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.015
matter that much, but, um,

00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:02.620
if we have less than it,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.720
like it denotes that this is

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.020
the line segment that we're looking at on this interval.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.370
So it just makes more sense to keep it that

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.230
way because we get the new data point in that

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.435
specifies a new slope that we have.

00:08:16.435 --> 00:08:22.015
-Okay. -Yeah, so let's see here.

00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:23.920
So then we can just multiply this to get

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.095
r. We can multiply this over to get her in line.

00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:29.320
So then we would have that f of t

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:37.345
minus 0.61 is equal to 0.43 times t minus one.

00:08:37.345 --> 00:08:40.405
Then we can just move that to the other side.

00:08:40.405 --> 00:08:42.070
And I'll just put that in here

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.150
because That's just the last step.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:54.665
So f of t is equal to 0.43 t minus one plus 0.61,

00:08:54.665 --> 00:08:56.795
and this is between 13.

00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:58.170
-Okay

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.355
-Now, okay, to be careful,

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:04.820
or we should be careful that at the last endpoint,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.770
we wanted to have it be a closed interval.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.285
-oh because we have that defining that -right, yeah, okay.

00:09:11.285 --> 00:09:14.570
Okay, So, okay.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.770
So let's see.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:16.850
So let's do one more and

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.590
then let's do one more really fast.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:24.125
So 3 to 5, we have f of t

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:31.775
minus 1.47 over t minus three is equal to 0.27.

00:09:31.775 --> 00:09:33.410
Multiply that over again,

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:41.075
we get f of t minus 1.47 is equal to 0.27 t minus three.

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:45.920
And so if we plug that in here, add that over,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.510
then we get 0.27 minus

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:58.385
three plus 1.47 from T 3 between 5,

00:09:58.385 --> 00:10:00.710
and then I'll Sunday the others.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.185
So I think that's all we need to do for now.

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:03.980
-Okay

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:04.745
Okay.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:07.895
Alright, and so now for this last part,

00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:12.485
we have to figure out what is going to between 11 and 13.

00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:15.245
So since you said we don't have to be exact,

00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:16.970
we can say it's gonna be

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:19.594
decreasing following this pattern.

00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:21.380
So it's gonna be negative and

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.680
maybe about negative 0.1. -Yeah.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.050
I don't think you need to say it that precisely,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.955
but yeah, I think it's something like that.

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:32.945
I just put from mine that's just like decreasing.

00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:35.460
And then shallower than

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:47.740
shallower than on the interval 9-11.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.685
-Oh, okay.

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:49.915
That's that's it.

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:51.220
I wasn't doing well done.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.560
Yeah. No. I think it's shorter than it looks.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.830
It's just a lot of like computing outlines and stuff.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.100
Can you went when you finish writing all this up,

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.480
can you help me on this organic

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.890
chemistry problem I'm working on?

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:03.910
It's really, really hard

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.050
and I don't know what to do about it.
